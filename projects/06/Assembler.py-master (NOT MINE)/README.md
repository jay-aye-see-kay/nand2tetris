#Assembler in Python
Runs in O(n)

Write an Assembler program that translates programs written in the
symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code that can execute on
the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects.

To run this program execute the shell script make.sh from the command
line. This will generate all the necessary .hack files from .asm files using
a python script (Assembler.py)

Once this has been completed open up the Assembler.sh
and load up the .asm and corresponding hack files and compare their output.
